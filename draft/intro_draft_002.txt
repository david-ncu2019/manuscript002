## **OPTION 1: The "Direct Problem Statement" Approach**
**Structure**: Problem → Gap → Objective → Method (4–5 paragraphs)

### **Draft**:

**¶1 - Core Problem (3-4 sentences)**
> Quantifying depth-dependent contributions to land subsidence is critical for effective groundwater management, yet remains a persistent challenge in subsidence-affected regions worldwide (Galloway & Burbey, 2011). While surface deformation can be measured comprehensively using geodetic techniques such as InSAR, leveling, and GNSS (Ferretti et al., 2011; Hung et al., 2010), these methods provide no information about subsurface processes. Multilayer compaction monitoring wells (MLCWs), which employ magnetic extensometers to measure layer-specific compaction at multiple depth intervals (Riley, 1998), offer the only direct measurements of stratigraphic contributions. However, their sparse spatial distribution—constrained by high installation costs (>US$100,000 per well) and logistical complexity—limits their utility for comprehensive subsidence characterization (Sneed & Brandt, 2007).

**¶2 - Study Area Context (2-3 sentences)**
> The Choushui River Fluvial Plain (CRFP) in central Taiwan exemplifies this challenge. Decades of intensive groundwater extraction for agriculture and aquaculture have caused cumulative subsidence exceeding 3 m since the 1970s, threatening critical infrastructure including the Taiwan High Speed Rail (Tung & Hu, 2012; Hwang et al., 2016). Despite an extensive monitoring network including ~30 MLCWs, ~500 leveling benchmarks, continuous GNSS stations, and systematic Sentinel-1 InSAR coverage since 2014, spatial extrapolation of layer-specific compaction patterns remains unresolved.

**¶3 - Research Gap (3-4 sentences)**
> The fundamental challenge is establishing quantitative relationships between sparse MLCW measurements and spatially continuous predictors such as InSAR surface displacement. Simple ratio-based interpolation (e.g., kriging Layer_i/InSAR proportions) fails to capture the spatial heterogeneity inherent in subsidence systems, where layer contributions vary with geological structure, aquitard thickness, consolidation state, and pumping patterns (Poland & Davis, 1969; Helm, 1975). Moreover, such approaches provide no statistical framework for assessing relationship strength or identifying regions where specific layers dominate subsidence. A method that explicitly models spatially varying sensitivity coefficients—representing the coupling strength between layer-specific compaction and surface expression—is needed.

**¶4 - Objective & Approach (3-4 sentences)**
> This study employs Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) to establish spatially varying relationships between MLCW-measured layer compaction and InSAR surface deformation across the CRFP. Unlike global regression approaches that assume constant relationships, GWR estimates location-specific coefficients by fitting local models using distance-weighted neighboring observations (Brunsdon et al., 1996; Fotheringham et al., 2002), explicitly accommodating the spatial non-stationarity characteristic of geological and hydrological systems. We analyze 67 months (2015–2021) of SBAS-InSAR and MLCW data for four depth intervals (0–50 m, 50–150 m, 150–250 m, 250–300 m), comparing GWR performance against ordinary least squares (OLS) regression and evaluating coefficient reliability using synthetic experiments with known ground truth.

**¶5 - Contribution & Structure (2-3 sentences)**
> Our results demonstrate that GWR successfully identifies the 50–150 m aquifer as the dominant subsidence driver (R² = 0.43) and reveals systematic spatial patterns in layer-surface coupling strength. While synthetic tests confirm that time-sliced GWR cannot provide quantitatively accurate inversions, the method offers valuable exploratory capability for identifying where and when specific layers control subsidence. The remainder of this paper describes the study area and datasets (Section 2), GWR methodology and validation (Section 3), results from real data application (Section 4), implications and limitations (Section 5), and conclusions (Section 6).

## **OPTION 2: The "Why This Matters" Approach**
**Structure**: Impact → Challenge → Solution → Validation (4 paragraphs)

### **Draft**:

**¶1 - Impact Statement (2-3 sentences)**
> Land subsidence threatens critical infrastructure, agriculture, and coastal resilience in groundwater-dependent regions worldwide, with damages exceeding billions of dollars annually (Gambolati & Teatini, 2015; Chaussard et al., 2013). Effective mitigation requires understanding which aquifer systems contribute most to surface displacement—information that guides targeted pumping restrictions, aquifer recharge programs, and infrastructure protection strategies (Galloway et al., 1999; Faunt et al., 2016). However, current monitoring capabilities provide either spatially comprehensive surface measurements (InSAR, GNSS, leveling) or depth-resolved subsurface data (multilayer compaction wells, MLCWs), but rarely both at operational scales.

**¶2 - The Spatial Extrapolation Challenge (4-5 sentences)**
> MLCWs employ magnetic ring extensometers anchored at multiple depths to measure layer-specific compaction continuously (Riley, 1998), offering the only direct observations of stratigraphic contributions to subsidence. Yet their deployment remains severely limited by costs exceeding US$100,000 per installation and logistical constraints of drilling 250–300 m boreholes (Sneed & Brandt, 2007). In Taiwan's Choushui River Fluvial Plain (CRFP)—one of the world's most intensely monitored subsidence zones—only ~30 MLCWs cover a 2,000 km² area experiencing 3–7 cm/year subsidence rates (Hung et al., 2010; Tung & Hu, 2012). Consequently, while high-resolution InSAR provides wall-to-wall surface deformation maps with 12-day Sentinel-1 revisits (Berardino et al., 2002), translating these surface observations into depth-dependent compaction patterns remains an unsolved inverse problem.

**¶3 - Proposed Solution (4-5 sentences)**
> This study addresses the spatial extrapolation problem by modeling spatially varying relationships between MLCW layer compaction and InSAR surface displacement using Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR). GWR estimates location-specific sensitivity coefficients that quantify how strongly each layer's compaction couples to surface deformation, accommodating the spatial heterogeneity arising from variable geology, hydraulic connectivity, and consolidation history (Brunsdon et al., 1996; Fotheringham et al., 2002; Comber et al., 2020). Applied to 67 months of synchronized SBAS-InSAR and four-layer MLCW data from the CRFP, our approach identifies which depths dominate subsidence contributions, where these contributions vary spatially, and when temporal changes in layer-surface coupling occur. Importantly, we test GWR reliability using synthetic subsidence scenarios with known layer contributions, establishing both the method's exploratory strengths and its limitations for quantitative inversion.

**¶4 - Key Findings & Paper Structure (2-3 sentences)**
> Results demonstrate that the 50–150 m aquifer exhibits the strongest and most spatially coherent relationship with surface subsidence (average GWR R² = 0.43 vs. OLS R² = 0.03), while shallow (0–50 m) and deep (250–300 m) layers show weaker, more diffuse coupling. Synthetic validation reveals that while GWR achieves high model fit, estimated coefficients cannot be interpreted as exact physical contributions—a critical distinction for proper application. We present the study area, datasets, and GWR methodology in Sections 2–3, real data results in Section 4, and discussion of implications, limitations, and future directions in Sections 5–6.

## **OPTION 3: The "Knowledge Gap" Approach**
**Structure**: What We Know → What We Don't Know → What We'll Do → Why It Matters (4 paragraphs)

### **Draft**:

**¶1 - Current State of Knowledge (3-4 sentences)**
> Surface deformation monitoring has advanced dramatically with InSAR time-series techniques, enabling millimeter-precision measurements of land subsidence at regional scales with systematic Sentinel-1 coverage (Ferretti et al., 2011; Berardino et al., 2002). Complementary point-based techniques—leveling, GNSS, and extensometers—provide independent validation and long-term continuity (Galloway & Burbey, 2011). Subsurface monitoring using multilayer compaction wells (MLCWs) with magnetic ring extensometers can resolve which stratigraphic intervals drive surface displacement, identifying primary compaction zones critical for management (Riley, 1998; Sneed & Brandt, 2007). These technological capabilities have transformed subsidence science from qualitative description to quantitative characterization in regions worldwide (Hung et al., 2010; Chaussard et al., 2013).

**¶2 - Critical Knowledge Gap (3-4 sentences)**
> However, a fundamental disconnect persists: surface techniques provide comprehensive spatial coverage but no depth information, while MLCWs offer depth resolution at sparse point locations (typically <0.01 wells/km² due to costs exceeding US$100,000 per installation). Consequently, subsidence researchers face a persistent question: **how can spatially continuous surface measurements be decomposed into layer-specific contributions when direct subsurface observations are spatially sparse?** This question is particularly acute in heterogeneous geological settings where layer contributions vary spatially due to stratigraphic architecture, consolidation state, and differential pumping stress (Poland & Davis, 1969; Helm, 1975). Simple interpolation of layer-surface ratios fails to capture this spatial non-stationarity or provide statistical assessments of relationship strength.

**¶3 - Research Objective & Methodology (4-5 sentences)**
> We propose using Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) to establish spatially varying empirical relationships between MLCW layer compaction and InSAR surface deformation, effectively "translating" continuous surface observations into depth-dependent compaction patterns. GWR estimates location-specific sensitivity coefficients by fitting local regression models using distance-weighted neighboring data points, explicitly capturing spatial heterogeneity in predictor-response relationships (Brunsdon et al., 1996; Fotheringham et al., 2002). We apply this framework to Taiwan's Choushui River Fluvial Plain, where 67 months of SBAS-InSAR data (2015–2021) and four-layer MLCW measurements (~30 wells) provide an ideal testbed. Critically, we validate the approach using synthetic subsidence scenarios with known layer contributions, rigorously testing whether GWR-estimated coefficients recover true physical relationships or merely fit statistical patterns.

**¶4 - Contribution & Significance (2-3 sentences)**
> Our analysis reveals that GWR successfully identifies dominant compaction layers (50–150 m aquifer, R² = 0.43) and maps spatial variations in layer-surface coupling, but synthetic tests demonstrate systematic coefficient biases precluding quantitative inversion. These findings establish GWR as a valuable exploratory tool for hypothesis generation and spatial pattern analysis, while highlighting the need for constrained inverse methods (e.g., Bayesian hierarchical models) for rigorous layer contribution estimation. The methodology and validation framework presented here are transferable to other subsidence regions with combined InSAR-MLCW monitoring.
