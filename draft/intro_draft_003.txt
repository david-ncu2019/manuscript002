## **OPTION 1 REVISED: The "Sensitivity Mapping" Approach**
**Structure**: Problem → Gap → Objective → Method (4–5 paragraphs)

### **Draft**:

**¶1 - Core Problem (3-4 sentences)**
> Understanding spatial patterns in how subsurface compaction couples to surface deformation is critical for effective groundwater management in subsidence-prone regions (Galloway & Burbey, 2011). While InSAR provides spatially continuous surface displacement measurements and multilayer compaction monitoring wells (MLCWs) resolve layer-specific compaction using magnetic extensometers (Riley, 1998), their integration for comprehensive subsidence characterization remains challenging. MLCWs are sparsely distributed due to high installation costs (>US$100,000 per well) and drilling complexity, yielding point measurements that cannot be directly interpolated across heterogeneous geological settings (Sneed & Brandt, 2007). The central challenge is not precise decomposition of surface subsidence into layer contributions—a physically constrained inverse problem requiring process-based modeling—but rather identifying **where and when** specific depth intervals exhibit strong versus weak coupling to surface deformation.

**¶2 - Study Area Context (2-3 sentences)**
> The Choushui River Fluvial Plain (CRFP) in central Taiwan exemplifies this challenge. Decades of intensive groundwater extraction for agriculture have caused cumulative subsidence exceeding 3 m, threatening the Taiwan High Speed Rail and other critical infrastructure (Tung & Hu, 2012; Hwang et al., 2016). Despite ~30 MLCWs, ~500 leveling benchmarks, continuous GNSS stations, and systematic Sentinel-1 InSAR coverage since 2014, spatial patterns of layer-specific subsidence sensitivity remain poorly characterized (Hung et al., 2010).

**¶3 - Research Gap (4-5 sentences)**
> Existing approaches to spatial extrapolation of MLCW data face fundamental limitations. Simple ratio-based interpolation (e.g., kriging Layer_i/InSAR proportions at observed locations, then interpolating) treats derived quantities as independent observations, ignoring the underlying statistical relationship and providing no framework for assessing coupling strength or spatial heterogeneity (Fotheringham et al., 2002). Global regression models assume constant layer-surface relationships across space, contradicting known geological and hydrological variability in compressibility, hydraulic connectivity, and consolidation state (Poland & Davis, 1969; Helm, 1975). What is needed is a method that: (1) explicitly models **spatially varying sensitivity** of surface deformation to layer-specific compaction, (2) provides statistical measures of relationship strength at each location, and (3) enables interpretation of coefficients as **relative indices** rather than exact physical contributions, acknowledging the exploratory nature of empirical spatial modeling.

**¶4 - Objective & Approach (5-6 sentences)**
> This study employs Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) to generate spatially continuous maps of layer-specific subsidence sensitivity across the CRFP, treating GWR coefficients as **sensitivity indices** that indicate the strength of coupling between layer compaction and surface displacement. GWR estimates location-specific regression coefficients by fitting local models using distance-weighted neighboring observations (Brunsdon et al., 1996), explicitly accommodating spatial non-stationarity in layer-surface relationships. We analyze 67 months (2015–2021) of SBAS-InSAR and four-layer MLCW data (0–50 m, 50–150 m, 150–250 m, 250–300 m), comparing GWR performance against ordinary least squares (OLS) regression and evaluating coefficient patterns through two complementary analyses: (1) **temporal correlation** between GWR-derived sensitivity indices and groundwater level fluctuations, testing whether coefficients vary systematically with hydraulic stress; and (2) **spatial correlation** between sensitivity indices and fine-grained sediment content from borehole data, testing whether geological controls on compressibility are reflected in layer-surface coupling patterns. Synthetic experiments with known ground truth establish that GWR coefficients cannot be interpreted as exact physical fractions, but successfully preserve spatial ranking and relative magnitudes—validating their use as exploratory sensitivity metrics.

**¶5 - Contribution & Structure (3-4 sentences)**
> Our results demonstrate that the 50–150 m aquifer exhibits the highest and most spatially coherent sensitivity to surface subsidence (average GWR R² = 0.43 vs. OLS R² = 0.03), with sensitivity indices showing significant positive correlation with fine-grained sediment content (ρ = X, p < 0.05) and [positive/negative/weak] temporal correlation with groundwater level variations. These findings identify the mid-depth aquifer as the primary driver of spatially structured subsidence patterns, while shallow (0–50 m) and deep (250–300 m) layers exhibit weak, diffuse sensitivity consistent with hysteresis effects and hydraulic lag, respectively. The methodology provides a transferable framework for subsidence monitoring programs to leverage combined InSAR-MLCW datasets for comprehensive sensitivity mapping, guiding targeted mitigation strategies. Section 2 describes the study area and datasets, Section 3 presents GWR methodology and validation, Section 4 reports results and correlation analyses, and Sections 5–6 discuss implications and conclusions.

**Length**: ~450–500 words  
**Key changes**:
- Emphasizes "sensitivity mapping" not "decomposition"
- Explicitly frames coefficients as "sensitivity indices"

## **OPTION 2 REVISED: The "Pattern Discovery" Approach**
**Structure**: Impact → Challenge → Solution → Validation (4 paragraphs)

### **Draft**:

**¶1 - Impact Statement (3-4 sentences)**
> Effective land subsidence management requires identifying which aquifer systems exhibit the strongest coupling to surface deformation—information that guides targeted pumping restrictions, aquifer recharge programs, and infrastructure risk assessment (Galloway et al., 1999; Faunt et al., 2016). While spatially comprehensive surface monitoring (InSAR, GNSS, leveling) and depth-resolved subsurface measurements (multilayer compaction wells) are both operationally available, translating point-based layer observations into spatial patterns of subsidence sensitivity remains a persistent challenge (Hung et al., 2010). This is not a problem of precise inverse modeling—which requires physics-based consolidation models with constrained parameters—but rather one of **exploratory spatial analysis**: mapping where specific depth intervals show strong versus weak statistical relationships with surface displacement, and understanding what geological and hydrological factors drive this spatial variability.

**¶2 - The Sensitivity Mapping Challenge (4-5 sentences)**
> Taiwan's Choushui River Fluvial Plain (CRFP) provides an ideal testbed for addressing this challenge. The region hosts one of the world's densest subsidence monitoring networks: ~30 multilayer compaction wells (MLCWs) measuring layer-specific compaction at four depth intervals (0–50 m, 50–150 m, 150–250 m, 250–300 m), continuous Sentinel-1 InSAR coverage since 2014, and auxiliary datasets including daily groundwater level measurements and detailed borehole lithology characterizing fine-grained sediment distributions (Tung & Hu, 2012; Hung et al., 2018). Yet with only ~0.015 wells/km² across the 2,000 km² plain—constrained by installation costs exceeding US$100,000 per well—direct interpolation of MLCW measurements is inappropriate for capturing the spatial heterogeneity induced by variable geology, pumping patterns, and consolidation history (Poland & Davis, 1969). Standard global regression assumes spatially constant layer-surface relationships, while kriging proportions (Layer_i/InSAR) treats derived ratios as independent observations without modeling the underlying statistical dependency (Fotheringham et al., 2002; Comber et al., 2020).

**¶3 - Proposed Approach (5-6 sentences)**
> This study applies Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) to map spatially varying sensitivity of surface subsidence to layer-specific compaction, treating estimated coefficients as **relative sensitivity indices** rather than exact physical contributions. GWR fits local regression models at each location using distance-weighted neighboring observations, producing maps of layer-surface coupling strength alongside local goodness-of-fit metrics (local R²) that identify where relationships are statistically robust versus weak (Brunsdon et al., 1996; Fotheringham et al., 2002). Applied to 67 months of synchronized SBAS-InSAR and MLCW data, our analysis generates spatially continuous sensitivity maps for each depth interval, then validates their physical meaningfulness through two complementary assessments: (1) **spatial correlation** between GWR-derived sensitivity indices and fine-grained sediment content from borehole logs, testing whether geological controls on compressibility manifest in layer-surface coupling patterns (Lu et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2022); and (2) **temporal correlation** between monthly variations in sensitivity coefficients and groundwater level fluctuations at each station, testing whether observed coefficient variability reflects genuine hydrological forcing or merely methodological artifacts. Synthetic validation experiments establish that while GWR coefficients exhibit systematic biases precluding quantitative interpretation as physical fractions, they successfully preserve spatial rankings and respond to known geological patterns—validating their use for exploratory sensitivity mapping.

**¶4 - Key Findings & Paper Structure (3-4 sentences)**
> Results identify the 50–150 m aquifer as exhibiting the highest and most spatially coherent sensitivity to surface subsidence (average GWR R² = 0.43), with sensitivity indices showing [strong/moderate] positive correlation with clay/silt content (ρ = X, p < Y), confirming that geological compressibility controls are reflected in statistical coupling patterns. Temporal analysis reveals [significant/weak] correlation between coefficient variations and groundwater level changes, suggesting [that sensitivity does vary with hydraulic state / that much coefficient variability is methodological noise]. These findings provide actionable spatial guidance for subsidence management: areas with high Layer 2 sensitivity indices warrant prioritized monitoring and pumping restrictions. We describe the study area, datasets, and GWR framework in Sections 2–3, present sensitivity mapping and validation results in Section 4, and discuss implications, limitations, and future directions in Sections 5–6.

**Length**: ~500–550 words  
**Key changes**:
- Frames as "pattern discovery" rather than "inversion"
- Embeds correlation analyses as validation strategy
- Explicitly positions coefficients as "relative indices"
- Clear about exploratory vs. physics-based modeling distinction

## **OPTION 3 REVISED: The "Diagnostic Tool" Approach**
**Structure**: Question → Method → Application → Validation (4 paragraphs)

### **Draft**:

**¶1 - Central Question (3-4 sentences)**
> A persistent question in subsidence-affected regions is: **which aquifer systems show the strongest coupling to surface deformation, where does this coupling vary spatially, and what geological or hydrological factors control this variability?** Answering this question does not require precise inverse modeling to recover exact layer contributions—a physics-constrained problem demanding consolidation models, hydraulic parameters, and stress-strain constitutive relationships (Helm, 1975; Teatini et al., 2011). Rather, it requires diagnostic tools that map **relative sensitivity patterns** from available monitoring data, providing actionable spatial guidance for management decisions without claiming quantitative accuracy (Galloway & Burbey, 2011). While multilayer compaction wells (MLCWs) directly measure layer-specific compaction and InSAR provides spatially continuous surface deformation, integrating these complementary datasets to generate comprehensive sensitivity maps remains methodologically underdeveloped.

**¶2 - Methodological Approach (4-5 sentences)**
> We propose treating this as an exploratory spatial analysis problem addressable through Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR), a local regression technique that estimates spatially varying coefficients representing how strongly layer compaction couples to surface displacement at each location (Brunsdon et al., 1996; Fotheringham et al., 2002). Unlike global regression (which assumes spatial stationarity) or geostatistical interpolation (which smooths values without modeling relationships), GWR explicitly captures spatial heterogeneity in predictor-response associations while providing diagnostic metrics (local R², coefficient standard errors) that reveal where relationships are robust versus weak (Comber et al., 2020). Critically, we interpret GWR coefficients not as exact physical contributions but as **sensitivity indices**: larger coefficients indicate locations where a given layer's compaction more strongly associates with surface subsidence, enabling relative comparisons across space and between layers. This framing aligns with GWR's statistical foundation as an exploratory spatial data analysis method rather than a physical inversion technique.

**¶3 - Application to CRFP (4-5 sentences)**
> We apply this framework to Taiwan's Choushui River Fluvial Plain, analyzing 67 months (2015–2021) of SBAS-InSAR surface displacement and four-layer MLCW compaction data (0–50 m, 50–150 m, 150–250 m, 250–300 m) from ~30 wells distributed across 2,000 km² experiencing 3–7 cm/year subsidence rates (Tung & Hu, 2012; Hung et al., 2018). For each layer and month, we estimate spatially varying sensitivity coefficients using adaptive bandwidth GWR, generating maps that identify: (1) which depth interval exhibits the highest coupling to surface subsidence, (2) where this coupling is spatially concentrated versus diffuse, and (3) how coupling strength varies temporally. To assess whether sensitivity patterns reflect genuine geological and hydrological controls rather than statistical artifacts, we validate coefficient maps through **spatial correlation with fine-grained sediment content** from borehole lithology data (testing the hypothesis that higher clay/silt content → higher compressibility → stronger layer-surface coupling) and **temporal correlation with groundwater level fluctuations** at each station (testing whether coefficient variability tracks hydraulic stress changes or represents noise).

**¶4 - Validation & Contributions (3-4 sentences)**
> Synthetic experiments confirm that while GWR cannot recover exact physical contribution fractions (showing systematic biases of 100–800% in controlled tests), spatial rankings and relative magnitudes are preserved—validating the sensitivity index interpretation. Applied to real CRFP data, results reveal that the 50–150 m aquifer consistently exhibits the highest sensitivity (average R² = 0.43 vs. 0.14–0.18 for other layers) with [strong/moderate] correlation to fine-grained content (ρ = X) and [significant/weak] correlation to groundwater levels. This study provides a transferable methodology for subsidence programs to leverage combined InSAR-MLCW datasets for actionable sensitivity mapping, while rigorously establishing appropriate interpretation frameworks that acknowledge both capabilities and limitations. Section 2 describes datasets and preprocessing, Section 3 presents GWR implementation and synthetic validation, Section 4 reports sensitivity mapping and correlation results, and Sections 5–6 discuss implications for subsidence management and future research directions.

- Opens with a question that sensitivity mapping answers
- Distinguishes diagnostic analysis from inverse modeling
- Presents correlation analyses as physical validation
