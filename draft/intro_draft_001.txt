## **Introduction**

Land subsidence, the gradual settling or sudden sinking of the Earth's surface, has emerged as a critical global challenge affecting millions of people across more than 150 countries (Galloway & Burbey, 2011; Gambolati & Teatini, 2015). While land subsidence can result from natural processes such as tectonic activity, sediment consolidation, and dissolution of subsurface materials, anthropogenic factors—particularly excessive groundwater extraction—have become the predominant driver in recent decades (Poland & Davis, 1969; Galloway et al., 1999). Groundwater-induced subsidence occurs when aquifer system compaction, triggered by lowering hydraulic heads and increased effective stress, propagates to the land surface (Terzaghi, 1925; Helm, 1975). This phenomenon poses severe threats to infrastructure integrity, exacerbates flood risk in coastal areas, and causes damage to buildings, transportation networks, and agricultural systems (Erban et al., 2014; Chaussard et al., 2013).

The Choushui River Fluvial Plain (CRFP) in central western Taiwan exemplifies the acute land subsidence challenges facing intensive agricultural regions. Covering approximately 2,000 km² between Changhua and Yunlin counties, the CRFP serves as one of Taiwan's most productive agricultural zones, supporting extensive rice cultivation and aquaculture operations (Liu et al., 2004; Tung & Hu, 2012). However, the region's reliance on groundwater—necessitated by insufficient surface water availability—has led to decades of overextraction exceeding natural recharge rates (Hung et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2007). Cumulative subsidence in some areas has surpassed 3 meters since the 1970s, with ongoing rates of 3–7 cm/year in subsidence hotspots (Tung & Hu, 2012; Hung et al., 2012). This widespread land lowering poses direct threats to critical infrastructure, most notably the Taiwan High Speed Rail (THSR), which traverses the eastern margin of the subsiding area (Hwang et al., 2016). Differential subsidence along the rail corridor risks track deformation and structural damage, while agricultural facilities, drainage systems, coastal protection works, and residential buildings face ongoing deterioration (Chen et al., 2010; Hsu et al., 2015).

To monitor and mitigate land subsidence in the CRFP, Taiwanese authorities have established an extensive multi-technique geodetic monitoring network since the 1990s (Hung et al., 2010). This system integrates leveling surveys with approximately 500 benchmarks distributed across the plain, continuous Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) stations providing millimeter-precision vertical displacement measurements, and groundwater level monitoring wells tracking hydraulic head variations in multiple aquifer systems (Hung et al., 2012; Hsu et al., 2015). While these traditional techniques offer high temporal resolution and long-term continuity, their point-based nature limits spatial coverage and precludes comprehensive mapping of subsidence patterns (Chen et al., 2007). The advent of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), particularly time-series techniques such as Small Baseline Subset (SBAS), has revolutionized subsidence monitoring by providing spatially continuous deformation measurements with centimeter- to millimeter-level accuracy (Berardino et al., 2002; Ferretti et al., 2011). The Sentinel-1 mission, operational since 2014 with systematic 12-day repeat acquisitions, has enabled routine InSAR-based subsidence mapping over the CRFP, revealing detailed spatial patterns of surface displacement (Yen et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2017; Tung et al., 2021).

Despite advances in surface deformation monitoring, geodetic techniques—including InSAR, GNSS, and leveling—measure only cumulative vertical displacement at or near the land surface, providing no direct information about the depth-dependent subsurface processes driving subsidence (Galloway & Burbey, 2011). Understanding which stratigraphic intervals contribute most to surface subsidence is critical for developing effective management strategies, as different aquifer layers respond differently to hydraulic stress depending on their lithology, thickness, consolidation history, and pumping intensity (Poland & Davis, 1969; Hoffman et al., 2001). To address this limitation, multilayer compaction monitoring wells (MLCWs) have been installed at strategic locations throughout the CRFP since the early 2000s (Hung et al., 2012; Hsu et al., 2015). These specialized wells employ magnetic ring extensometers anchored at multiple depth intervals (typically 4–7 layers spanning 0–300 m) to measure layer-specific vertical compaction continuously (Riley, 1998; Sneed & Brandt, 2007). MLCW data have proven invaluable for identifying primary compaction zones, calibrating hydrogeological models, and assessing the relative contributions of shallow versus deep aquifer systems (Hung et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2011).

However, MLCW deployment faces substantial practical constraints that limit their utility for comprehensive subsidence characterization. First, installation costs are prohibitively high—each well requires drilling to depths of 250–300 m, precise placement of magnetic rings, and construction of protective casings—resulting in unit costs exceeding US$100,000 (Sneed & Brandt, 2007; Faunt et al., 2016). Second, data retrieval requires manual field surveys using magnetic probe systems, typically conducted monthly or quarterly, yielding lower temporal resolution than automated systems (Riley, 1998). Third, the sparse spatial distribution—approximately 30 MLCWs across the 2,000 km² CRFP—provides inadequate coverage for mapping layer-specific compaction patterns or capturing fine-scale spatial heterogeneity (Hung et al., 2012). Consequently, while MLCWs offer critical depth-resolved information at point locations, extrapolating these measurements across the plain remains challenging.

In contrast to the logistical challenges of MLCW expansion, several complementary datasets offer broader spatial coverage and higher accessibility. InSAR-derived surface deformation maps provide wall-to-wall measurements at ~20 m spatial resolution with 12-day revisit frequency from Sentinel-1 (Torres et al., 2012), enabling dense spatiotemporal sampling of subsidence patterns. Groundwater level monitoring networks measure hydraulic heads daily at hundreds of wells distributed across multiple aquifer systems, capturing the hydrological forcing that drives compaction (Hung et al., 2010). Geological borehole databases compiled by the Taiwan Central Geological Survey contain grain-size analyses from thousands of drilling logs, enabling characterization of fine-grained (clay/silt) sediment distributions—the primary compressible materials (Chen et al., 2007). Electricity consumption data, collected routinely from all households and agricultural operations, serve as a proxy for groundwater pumping intensity since the majority of electrical usage in the CRFP is attributed to well pump operation (Tung & Hu, 2012). Land use classifications derived from satellite imagery document the spatial distribution of irrigation, aquaculture, and urban areas that govern water demand patterns (Liu et al., 2004). These datasets share common advantages: they are easier and less expensive to acquire than MLCWs, provide better spatial coverage, and exhibit longer historical records.

The central objective of this study is to establish quantitative relationships between layer-specific compaction measured by MLCWs and readily available spatial predictors—primarily InSAR surface deformation—to enable continuous mapping of subsurface compaction patterns across the CRFP. Specifically, we aim to determine spatially varying sensitivity coefficients that relate surface displacement (measured by InSAR) to compaction at each monitored depth interval. These coefficients represent the coupling strength between layer-specific consolidation and surface expression, which varies spatially due to heterogeneity in geological structure, aquitard thickness, consolidation state, and hydraulic connectivity (Poland & Davis, 1969; Helm, 1975). Successful estimation of such coefficients would enable: (1) spatial extrapolation of MLCW measurements to unmonitored areas using InSAR as a spatially continuous predictor; (2) identification of regions where specific aquifer intervals dominate subsidence contributions; (3) improved targeting of mitigation efforts toward critical compaction zones; and (4) enhanced predictive capability for subsidence response to future groundwater management scenarios.

To capture the spatial non-stationarity inherent in geological and hydrological systems, we employ Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR), a local regression technique that estimates spatially varying coefficients by fitting separate regression models at each location using distance-weighted observations from neighboring stations (Brunsdon et al., 1996; Fotheringham et al., 2002). Unlike global regression approaches that assume constant relationships across space, GWR explicitly accommodates spatial heterogeneity in predictor-response relationships—an essential characteristic for subsidence systems where layer contributions vary with position due to stratigraphic architecture, fault zone influence, and pumping distributions (Comber et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2014). While GWR has been widely applied to environmental and epidemiological studies (Harris et al., 2010; Gollini et al., 2015), its application to subsidence layer decomposition remains relatively unexplored. This study represents one of the first attempts to integrate GWR with InSAR and MLCW data for spatially explicit analysis of depth-dependent subsidence processes.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the study area hydrogeology and datasets; Section 3 presents the GWR methodology and synthetic validation experiments; Section 4 reports results of GWR application to real CRFP data; Section 5 discusses implications, limitations, and comparisons with alternative approaches; and Section 6 summarizes conclusions and recommendations for future research.
