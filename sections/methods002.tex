\subsection{SBAS-InSAR time series processing}
\label{subsec:sbas}

This study derived cumulative vertical displacement from an 8-year dataset of Sentinel-1 SAR images \text{(2016 - 2024)}, acquired from both ascending and descending orbits; the image properties are summarized in \Cref{tab:sentinel1_info}. First, the images from each acquisition orbit were processed separately applying the \textbf{\textit{hyp3-isce2}} plugin, part of the Hybrid Pluggable Processing Pipeline (HyP3) \citep{hyp3-isce2}. For interferogram formation, each SAR image was paired with up to four subsequent consecutive images to minimize temporal decorrelation. Next, each image pair was analyzed using the InSAR Scientific Computing Environment 2 (ISCE2) TOPS workflow, which sequentially performs burst-level coregistration of Single Look Complex (SLC) images, interferogram generation, waterbody masking and topographic phase correction with the Copernicus GLO-30 DEM, phase unwrapping via the SNAPHU algorithm, and geocoding to produce unwrapped interferograms suitable for further time-series InSAR analysis. A detailed description of the ISCE2 workflow is available in \citep{isce2_rosen, tops, nesd_tops}.

Subsequently, a time-series analysis was conducted on the unwrapped interferograms from ascending and descending orbits separately using the small baseline subset approach, provided by Miami InSAR Time-series software (MintPy) \citep{mintpy_yunjun}. The valid interferogram network was formed through a two-stage selection. The minimum spanning tree (MST) \citep{mst_perissin} first identified the most coherent interferograms to connect all SAR images, by using the inverse of the average spatial coherence of all interferograms as weight. After this, any interferograms not included in the MST were excluded if their average spatial coherence was lower than $\text{0.3}$. After network formation, the optimal values of the interferometric phase timeseries were estimated through a network inversion using the inverse of the phase variance as weight \citep{networkinverse_var}. The temporal coherence, as a product of the network inversion process, was utilized to evaluate the reliability of the estimated value at each pixel \citep{temporal_coherence}. Pixels with temporal coherence ($\gamma_\textit{temp}$) below 0.65 were then masked from further processing. Regarding atmospheric correction, the tropospheric delay components were removed based on the empirical linear relationship between InSAR phase delay and elevation \citep{height_correlation}. All interferograms from both ascending and descending orbits were referenced to a single stable point, which was located far from the subsiding area (\Cref{fig:insar_leveling_a}). Finally, the line-of-sight deformation (${d_\textit{LOS}}$) was decomposed into the east-west (${d_\textit{E-W}}$) and vertical (${d_\textit{U}}$) components, assuming the deformation in north-south direction (${d_\textit{N-S}}$) was negligible. The decomposition employed the incidence angles ($\theta$) and satellite heading angles ($\alpha$) from both ascending ($\textit{asc}$) and descending ($\textit{desc}$) images \citep{hanssen_book}:

\begin{equation}
	\begin{bmatrix}
		d_{\textit{U}} \\
		d_{\textit{E-W}}
	\end{bmatrix}
	=
	\begin{bmatrix}
		\cos(\theta^{\text{asc}}) & \sin(\theta^{\text{asc}}) \cos(\alpha^{\text{asc}}) \\
		\cos(\theta^{\text{desc}}) & \sin(\theta^{\text{desc}}) \cos(\alpha^{\text{desc}})
	\end{bmatrix}^{-1}
	\begin{bmatrix}
		d_{\textit{LOS}}^{\text{asc}} \\
		d_{\textit{LOS}}^{\text{desc}}
	\end{bmatrix}.

\end{equation}


Validation of the vertical displacements was performed against precise leveling survey, with benchmarks locations shown in \Cref{fig:studyarea}. First, reliable measurement points ($\gamma_\textit{temp} \ge 0.65$) within a 200 m radius of each benchmark were selected. Average velocities were then derived for these points from both the InSAR and annual leveling survey time series, calculated as the slope of the best-fitting line to their respective displacement time series. Such a comparison based on rates was required due to the different temporal sampling intervals of the two datasets \Cref{fig:insar_leveling}.

\section{Geographically Weighted Regression}
\label{sec:gwr}

This research models the complex relationship between monthly differential displacement from MLCW and InSAR. Traditional regression models, such as Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), are insufficient for this task. OLS assumes that the relationship between the response and predictor variables is constant, or \textbf{spatially stationary}, across the entire study area. This global model is expressed as:
%
\begin{equation}
	y_i = \sum_{k=0}^{p} \beta_k x_{ik} + \varepsilon_i
	\label{eq:ols}
\end{equation}
%
\noindent where \(y_i\) is the dependent variable, \(x_{ik}\) represents the predictors, \(\beta_k\) are the global coefficients, and \(\varepsilon_i\) is the random error at location \(i\). This "one-size-fits-all" assumption, however, fails in hydrogeology. The local geology can dramatically alter the relationship between surface and subsurface deformation from one location to another. Consequently, a global model can misspecify the relationship and produce misleading results \citep{mgwr_book_2017}.

Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR), a local regression technique, addresses this problem of spatial non-stationarity \citep{brunsdon1996, fotheringham2002geographically}. GWR relaxes the stationarity assumption by building a separate, local regression model for every point in the dataset. This approach allows the parameters to vary spatially, fitting a model defined as:
%
\begin{equation}
	y_i = \sum_{k=0}^{p} \beta_k(u_i, v_i) x_{ik} + \varepsilon_i
	\label{eq:gwr}
\end{equation}
%
\noindent The key difference is that the coefficients \(\beta_k\) are no longer global, fixed values. Instead, they are specific functions of the geographic coordinates \((u_i, v_i)\) for each location \(i\). GWR calibrates this model using two fundamental components, a kernel and a bandwidth. The kernel function assigns weights to neighboring observations based on their distance from the regression point \(i\), ensuring that closer points have more influence on the local coefficient estimates. The bandwidth, in turn, is the most critical parameter, as it defines the "size" of the neighborhood used by the kernel. A small bandwidth captures highly local variations, whereas a large bandwidth produces a smoother, more averaged result. If the bandwidth becomes large enough to include all data, the GWR model simply converges to the global OLS model.

GWR successfully accounts for spatial variability, but it is an inherently spatial model. The physical relationship between surface and subsurface deformation may also be \textbf{temporally non-stationary}. For instance, the aquifer system's mechanical response during a dry season likely differs from its response during a wet season. A standard GWR model with a single, fixed set of spatial parameters would fail to capture these dynamic changes. Calibrating the GWR model for separate, individual time steps, therefore, allows for the exploration of how these spatial relationships evolve, providing insight into the system's dynamic behavior over time.
