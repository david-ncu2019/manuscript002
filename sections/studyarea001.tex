%\section{Study Area Background}
%\label{subsec:study_area}



The CRFP belongs to the western coastal region of central Taiwan. CRFP has an area of approximately 2000 $km^2$, which belongs to the regions of Changhua, Yunlin, and the northern part of the Chiayi counties, with a surface elevation ranging from 0 m to 100 – 150 m above sea level. The CRFP boundary is shaped by Douliu Hill and Bagua Tableland on the eastern side, the Wu River to the north, the Beigang River to the south, and the Taiwan Strait to the west (Figure \ref{fig:studyarea}).
The hydrogeological structures of the study area are divided into three sections from the east to the west, namely proximal fan, middle fan, and distal fan \citep{RN46}. Each section was comprised of various sedimentary materials, with the average grain sizes decreasing from hilly regions to coastal areas. The sedimentary materials in the CRFP are divided into four primary groups, grading from very coarse grains to very fine grains: gravel, coarse sand, fine sand, and clay or silt \citep{RN46}. These materials are weathered products of rock formations located in the upstream watershed of the study area, such as slate, quartzite, shale, sandstone, and mudstone \citep{RN17, RN47}. The borehole profiles suggest that gravel and coarse sand are primarily present at the proximal fan and part of the middle fan, whereas the distal fan mainly witnesses fine-grain materials, including fine sand, clay, and silt (Figure \ref{fig:crosssection}).
