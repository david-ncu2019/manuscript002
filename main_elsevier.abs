Land subsidence from excessive groundwater extraction has long affected the Choushui River Fluvial Plain (CRFP) in Taiwan, increasing flood risks and threatening infrastructure like the Taiwan High Speed Rail (THSR). A network of multilayer compaction monitoring wells (MLCWs) aids in understanding subsidence mechanisms, but their high installation costs limit dense deployment. This study integrates SBAS-InSAR surface deformation data with MLCW measurements using geographically weighted regression (GWR) to map layer-wise compaction regionally. This approach enables cost-effective, high-resolution monitoring to inform groundwater management and infrastructure protection.
