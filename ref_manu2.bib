	abstract = {Spatial nonstationarity is a condition in which a simple “global” model cannot explain the relationships between some sets of variables. The nature of the model must alter over space to reflect the structure within the data. In this paper, a technique is developed, termed geographically weighted regression, which attempts to capture this variation by calibrating a multiple regression model which allows different relationships to exist at different points in space. This technique is loosely based on kernel regression. The method itself is introduced and related issues such as the choice of a spatial weighting function are discussed. Following this, a series of related statistical tests are considered which can be described generally as tests for spatial nonstationarity. Using Monte Carlo methods, techniques are proposed for investigating the null hypothesis that the data may be described by a global model rather than a non-stationary one and also for testing whether individual regression coefficients are stable over geographic space. These techniques are demonstrated on a data set from the 1991 U.K. census relating car ownership rates to social class and male unemployment. The paper concludes by discussing ways in which the technique can be extended.},

The method has been developed mainly along the lines of local regression and smoothing techniques, a strategy that has led to a number of difficult questions about the regularity conditions of the likelihood function, the effective number of degrees of freedom, and in general the relevance of extending the method to derive inference and model specification tests. In this paper we argue that placing GWR within a different statistical context, as a spatial model of error variance heterogeneity, or what might be termed locational heterogeneity, solves these difficulties. A maximum-likelihood-based framework for estimation and inference of a general geographically weighted regression model is presented that leads to a method to estimate location-specific kernel bandwidths. Moreover, a test for locational heterogeneity is derived and its use exemplified with a case study.}

	abstract = {Many different methods have been proposed to construct nonparametric estimates of a smooth regression function, including local polynomial, (convolution) kernel and smoothing spline estimators. Each of these estimators uses a smoothing parameter to control the amount of smoothing performed on a given data set. In this paper an improved version of a criterion based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC), termed AICC, is derived and examined as a way to choose the smoothing parameter. Unlike plug-in methods, AICC can be used to choose smoothing parameters for any linear smoother, including local quadratic and smoothing spline estimators. The use of AICC avoids the large variability and tendency to undersmooth (compared with the actual minimizer of average squared error) seen when other ‘classical’ approaches (such as generalized cross-validation (GCV) or the AIC) are used to choose the smoothing parameter. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the AICC-based smoothing parameter is competitive with a plug-in method (assuming that one exists) when the plug-in method works well but also performs well when the plug-in approach fails or is unavailable.},

	abstract = {Abstract Ever decreasing water resources and climate change have driven the increasing use of groundwater causing land subsidence in many countries. Geodetic sensors such as InSAR, GPS and leveling can detect surface deformation but cannot measure subsurface deformation. A single-well, single-depth extensometer can be used to measure subsurface deformation, but it cannot delineate the depths of major compaction and provide insight about the deformation mechanism throughout a complex aquifer system, unless man extensometers at different depths are used. We present a multilayer compaction well (MLCW), installed in a borehole, that uses magnetic rings to detect stratum compaction at 25 depths as deep as 300 m below land surface. Our laboratory and field assessments indicate 1 mm precision and accuracy for one single-depth magnetic reading. We tested the performance of MLCW by measuring aquifer-system compaction over the proximal, middle, and distal fans of the Choushui River Alluvial Fan (CRAF) that has long experienced severe land subsidence. The MLCW measurements were used to create time-depth diagrams of compaction, showing different compaction rates at different layers of aquifers and aquitards to identify the depths of major compactions. The elastic (reversible) and inelastic (irreversible) compactions from MLCW were used in stress-strain analyses to estimate skeletal specific storages and the safe groundwater levels, below which groundwater extractions have caused irreversible compactions. The hydrogeological parameters derived from MLCW measurements can help governmental agencies to determine effective land-use and water-use policies, and ascertain the best strategy for utilizing artificial recharge to prevent land subsidence and achieve sustainable groundwater management.},

	abstract = {We present a review of small baseline interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) time series analysis with a new processing workflow and software implemented in Python, named MintPy (https://github.com/insarlab/MintPy). The time series analysis is formulated as a weighted least squares inversion. The inversion is unbiased for a fully connected network of interferograms without multiple subsets, such as provided by modern SAR satellites with small orbital tube and short revisit time. In the routine workflow, we first invert the interferogram stack for the raw phase time-series, then correct for the deterministic phase components: the tropospheric delay (using global atmospheric models or the delay-elevation ratio), the topographic residual and/or phase ramp, to obtain the noise-reduced displacement time-series. Next, we estimate the average velocity excluding noisy SAR acquisitions, which are identified using an outlier detection method based on the root mean square of the residual phase. The routine workflow includes three new methods to correct or exclude phase-unwrapping errors for two-dimensional algorithms: (i) the bridging method connecting reliable regions with minimum spanning tree bridges (particularly suitable for islands), (ii) the phase closure method exploiting the conservativeness of the integer ambiguity of interferogram triplets (well suited for highly redundant networks), and (iii) coherence-based network modification to identify and exclude interferograms with remaining coherent phase-unwrapping errors. We apply the routine workflow to the Galápagos volcanoes using Sentinel-1 and ALOS-1 data, assess the qualities of the essential steps in the workflow and compare the results with independent GPS measurements. We discuss the advantages and limitations of temporal coherence as a reliability measure, evaluate the impact of network redundancy on the precision and reliability of the InSAR measurements and its practical implication for interferometric pairs selection. A comparison with another open-source time series analysis software demonstrates the superior performance of the approach implemented in MintPy in challenging scenarios.}

	abstract = {The main limiting factor on the accuracy of Interferometric SAR measurements (InSAR) comes from phase propagation delays through the troposphere. The delay can be divided into a stratified component, which correlates with the topography and often dominates the tropospheric signal, and a turbulent component. We use Global Atmospheric Models (GAM) to estimate the stratified phase delay and delay-elevation ratio at epochs of SAR acquisitions, and compare them to observed phase delay derived from SAR interferograms. Three test areas are selected with different geographic and climatic environments and with large SAR archive available. The Lake Mead, Nevada, USA is covered by 79 ERS1/2 and ENVISAT acquisitions, the Haiyuan Fault area, Gansu, China, by 24 ERS1/2 acquisitions, and the Afar region, Republic of Djibouti, by 91 Radarsat acquisitions. The hydrostatic and wet stratified delays are computed from GAM as a function of atmospheric pressure P, temperature T, and water vapor partial pressure e vertical profiles. The hydrostatic delay, which depends on ratio P/T, varies significantly at low elevation and cannot be neglected. The wet component of the delay depends mostly on the near surface specific humidity. GAM predicted delay-elevation ratios are in good agreement with the ratios derived from InSAR data away from deforming zones. Both estimations of the delay-elevation ratio can thus be used to perform a first order correction of the observed interferometric phase to retrieve a ground motion signal of low amplitude. We also demonstrate that aliasing of daily and seasonal variations in the stratified delay due to uneven sampling of SAR data significantly bias InSAR data stacks or time series produced after temporal smoothing. In all three test cases, the InSAR data stacks or smoothed time series present a residual stratified delay of the order of the expected deformation signal. In all cases, correcting interferograms from the stratified delay removes all these biases. We quantify the standard error associated with the correction of the stratified atmospheric delay. It varies from one site to another depending on the prevailing atmospheric conditions, but remains bounded by the standard deviation of the daily fluctuations of the stratified delay around the seasonal average. Finally we suggest that the phase delay correction can potentially be improved by introducing a non-linear dependence to the elevation derived from GAM.}

	abstract = { Scale is a fundamental geographic concept, and a substantial literature exists discussing the various roles that scale plays in different geographical contexts. Relatively little work exists, though, that provides a means of measuring the geographic scale over which different processes operate. Here we demonstrate how geographically weighted regression (GWR) can be adapted to provide such measures. GWR explores the potential spatial nonstationarity of relationships and provides a measure of the spatial scale at which processes operate through the determination of an optimal bandwidth. Classical GWR assumes that all of the processes being modeled operate at the same spatial scale, however. The work here relaxes this assumption by allowing different processes to operate at different spatial scales. This is achieved by deriving an optimal bandwidth vector in which each element indicates the spatial scale at which a particular process takes place. This new version of GWR is termed multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR), which is similar in intent to Bayesian nonseparable spatially varying coefficients (SVC) models, although potentially providing a more flexible and scalable framework in which to examine multiscale processes. Model calibration and bandwidth vector selection in MGWR are conducted using a back-fitting algorithm. We compare the performance of GWR and MGWR by applying both frameworks to two simulated data sets with known properties and to an empirical data set on Irish famine. Results indicate that MGWR not only is superior in replicating parameter surfaces with different levels of spatial heterogeneity but provides valuable information on the scale at which different processes operate. }

	abstract = {Effective water resource management requires accurate estimation of the volume of water withdrawn through anthropogenic groundwater pumping. However, insufficient pumping information makes accurate estimation difficult. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel method for estimating pumping volumes that does not rely on pumping information. The proposed method uses high-resolution groundwater level (GWL) data from densely monitored wells and integrates Hilbert–Huang transform and empirical orthogonal function analysis to extract pump-associated signals, which can then be used to estimate total pumping. Our method was validated by analyzing GWL data from monitoring stations on the Choshui River alluvial fan in Taiwan. The results indicate the estimated pumping amount of 1.71×109 – 2.05×109 m3/year consistent with previous estimates obtained using survey and physics-based methods ranging from 9×108 m3/year to 2.2×109 m3/year. In the areas with abundant groundwater head observations, the proposed method can efficiently estimate pumping rates with a high space–time resolution, and may serve as a useful reference for groundwater management.}

	ABSTRACT = {Land subsidence is an environmental hazard occurring gradually over time, potentially posing significant threats to the structural stability of civilian buildings and essential infrastructures. This study presented a workflow using the SBAS-PSInSAR approach to analyze surface deformation in the Choushui River Fluvial Plain (CRFP) based on Sentinel-1 SAR images and validated against precise leveling. Integrating the InSAR results with hydrogeological data, such as groundwater levels (GWLS), multilayer compactions, and borehole loggings, a straightforward model was proposed to estimate appropriate groundwater level drops to minimize further subsidence. The results showed a huge subsidence bowl centered in Yunlin, with maximal sinking at an average 60 mm/year rate. High-resolution subsidence maps enable the quantitative analyses of safety issues for Taiwan High-Speed Rail (THSR) across the areas with considerable subsidence. In addition, the analysis of hydrogeological data revealed that half of the major compaction in the study area occurred at shallow depths that mainly included the first and second aquifers. Based on a maximal subsidence control rate of 40 mm/year specified in the CRFP, the model results indicated that the groundwater level drops from wet to dry seasons needed to be maintained from 3 to 5 m for the shallowest aquifer and 4–6 m for Aquifers 3 and 4. The workflow demonstrated the compatibility of InSAR with traditional geodetic methods and the effectiveness of integrating multiple data sources to assess the complex nature of land subsidence in the CRFP.},

	abstract = {Nineteen percent of the global population may face a high probability of subsidence Subsidence, the lowering of Earth's land surface, is a potentially destructive hazard that can be caused by a wide range of natural or anthropogenic triggers but mainly results from solid or fluid mobilization underground. Subsidence due to groundwater depletion (1) is a slow and gradual process that develops on large time scales (months to years), producing progressive loss of land elevation (centimeters to decimeters per year) typically over very large areas (tens to thousands of square kilometers) and variably affects urban and agricultural areas worldwide. Subsidence permanently reduces aquifer-system storage capacity, causes earth fissures, damages buildings and civil infrastructure, and increases flood susceptibility and risk. During the next decades, global population and economic growth will continue to increase groundwater demand and accompanying groundwater depletion (2) and, when exacerbated by droughts (3), will probably increase land subsidence occurrence and related damages or impacts. To raise awareness and inform decision-making, we evaluate potential global subsidence due to groundwater depletion, a key first step toward formulating effective land-subsidence policies that are lacking in most countries worldwide.}}

	abstract = {Groundwater resources are vital to ecosystems and livelihoods. Excessive groundwater withdrawals can cause groundwater levels to decline1–10, resulting in seawater intrusion11, land subsidence12,13, streamflow depletion14–16 and wells running dry17. However, the global pace and prevalence of local groundwater declines are poorly constrained, because in situ groundwater levels have not been synthesized at the global scale. Here we analyse in situ groundwater-level trends for 170,000 monitoring wells and 1,693 aquifer systems in countries that encompass approximately 75% of global groundwater withdrawals18. We show that rapid groundwater-level declines (>0.5 m year−1) are widespread in the twenty-first century, especially in dry regions with extensive croplands. Critically, we also show that groundwater-level declines have accelerated over the past four decades in 30% of the world’s regional aquifers. This widespread acceleration in groundwater-level deepening highlights an urgent need for more effective measures to address groundwater depletion. Our analysis also reveals specific cases in which depletion trends have reversed following policy changes, managed aquifer recharge and surface-water diversions, demonstrating the potential for depleted aquifer systems to recover.},

Although this affects local rates of sea-level rise, assessments of the coastal impacts of subsidence are lacking on a global scale. Here, we quantify global-mean relative sea-level rise to be 2.6 mm yr−1 over the past two decades. However, as coastal inhabitants are preferentially located in subsiding locations, they experience an average relative sea-level rise up to four times faster at 7.8 to 9.9 mm yr−1. These results indicate that the impacts and adaptation needs are much higher than reported global sea-level rise measurements suggest. In particular, human-induced subsidence in and surrounding coastal cities can be rapidly reduced with appropriate policy for groundwater utilization and drainage. Such policy would offer substantial and rapid benefits to reduce growth of coastal flood exposure due to relative sea-level rise.},

The data reveal significant subsidence in nine areas, including six major cities, at rates up to 22cm/year. Land subsidence is detected near Lhokseumawe, in Medan, Jakarta, Bandung, Blanakan, Pekalongan, Bungbulang, Semarang, and in the Sidoarjo regency. The fastest subsidence occurs in highly populated coastal areas particularly vulnerable to flooding. We correlate the observed subsidence with surface geology and land use. Despite the fact that subsidence is taking place in compressible deposits there is no clear correlation between subsidence and surface geology. In urban areas we find a correlation between rapid, patchy subsidence and industrial land use and elsewhere with agricultural land use. This suggests that the subsidence is primarily caused by ground water extraction for industrial and agricultural use, respectively. We also observe subsidence associated with exploitation of gas fields near Lhokseumawe and in the Sidoarjo regency. A continuation of these high rates of subsidence is likely to put much of the densely populated coastal areas below relative sea level within a few decades.}

	journal = {Environmental Research Letters},
	abstract = {Groundwater exploitation is a major cause of land subsidence, which in coastal areas poses a flood inundation hazard that is compounded by the threat of sea-level rise (SLR). In the lower Mekong Delta, most of which lies &lt;2 m above sea level, over-exploitation is inducing widespread hydraulic head (i.e., groundwater level) declines. The average rate of head decline is ∼0.3 m yr−1, based on time-series data from 79 nested monitoring wells at 18 locations. The consequent compaction of sedimentary layers at these locations is calculated to be causing land subsidence at an average rate of 1.6 cm yr−1. We further measure recent subsidence rates (annual average, 2006–10) throughout the Delta, by analysis of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), using 78 ALOS PALSAR interferograms. InSAR-based subsidence rates are 1) consistent with compaction-based rates calculated at monitoring wells, and 2) ∼1–4 cm yr−1 over large (1000s of km2) regions. Ours are the first mapped estimates of Delta-wide land subsidence due to groundwater pumping. If pumping continues at present rates, ∼0.88 m (0.35–1.4 m) of land subsidence is expected by 2050. Anticipated SLR of ∼0.10 m (0.07–0.14 m) by 2050 will compound flood inundation potential. Our results suggest that by mid-century portions of the Mekong Delta will likely experience ∼1 m (0.42–1.54 m) of additional inundation hazard.}

	ABSTRACT = {The present review paper focuses on selected cases around the world of land subsidence phenomena caused by the overexploitation of aquifers. Land subsidence is closely related to human activity. In particular, the development of technology has led to an exponential increase in industrial and agricultural production, as well as extensive urbanization, mainly in large cities. The action of those parameters, along with the effects of climate change, has led to further increases in water demands, which have mainly been served by overexploitation of the aquifers. Overexploitation, in conjunction with broader geo-tectonic conditions, can trigger severe land subsidence phenomena, resulting in significant damage affecting the physical and man-made environment. The scope of the present study is to provide a critical review of the existing literature on land subsidence due to aquifer overexploitation and highlight the main causal factors driving this process. The methods developed in the past and their outcomes hold significant importance in sustainable development strategic planning.},

Understanding the current LS situation and the research trends is of paramount importance for further studies and addressing future international research networks. We analyzed the LS-related literature available from the Scopus database. The use of a single database avoided the redundancy of articles, while excluding some subject areas was useful to obtain only studies related to LS. By using VOSviewer and CiteSpace tools, we conducted a bibliometric analysis by considering title, keywords, and abstract to identify the temporal development, the geographical origin, and the area of study of the research. The results revealed a considerable heterogeneity of approaches, thematics, study areas, and research output trends. China, the US, and Italy are the major contributors to the scientific production, but the higher number of articles is not always related to the extension of the LS phenomenon in these countries. The monitoring approach differs worldwide, and univocal modeling is still lacking; from the analysis of the keywords, it is clear that the focus of most studies is on the relationship with the hydrological/hydrogeological aspects. Since the 2000s, however, the development of SAR technologies has boosted the study of the phenomenon from a different point of view.},

	abstract = {Abstract Many areas worldwide are known to experience land subsidence due to groundwater extraction. It is traditionally assumed that subsidence extent and rates are controlled by groundwater extraction locations and volumes. Here, we reevaluate this assumption in the Mexico City metropolitan area by combining stratigraphic, hydrologic, geodetic, and demographic datasets. Integration of 115 years of leveling with 24 years of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and 14 years of GPS data reveals that subsidence rates have been mostly constant in Mexico City since at least 1950 and reach 50 cm/year. Analysis of InSAR and GPS data shows that no significant elastic deformation exists, demonstrating that the subsidence is almost fully irreversible. In Mexico City, no direct relationships exist between groundwater level fluctuations and subsidence rates or between pumping rates and subsidence rates. In contrast, a strong positive linear relationship is isolated between subsidence rates and the thickness of the upper aquitard. Through the integration of these long-term datasets, we forecast that it will take ∼150 years to reach total compaction of the upper aquitard, which may lead to additional subsidence up to 30 m. With the potentiometric surface now deeper than most of the aquitard, clay's porewater rich in salts, chemical constituents, and pollutants is now flowing downward into the productive aquifer, hence decreasing water quality. Finally, our work shows that the consequences of land subsidence greatly influence the socioeconomic landscape in the Mexico City metropolitan area.},

	abstract = {The Central Valley in California is characterized by a semi-arid climate prone to droughts, a variable surface water supply, and immense agricultural areas dependent on groundwater irrigation. The groundwater is stored in a complex aquifer system composed of alternating layers of coarse sediments and fine-grained sediments acting as confining materials. Groundwater fluctuations are coupled with both the elastic and inelastic land surface deformation historically observed in the Central Valley. Surface deformation poses a hazard to the California Aqueduct, which supports Central Valley agriculture and large urban populations in Southern California. The risk of reduced aqueduct efficacy and expensive repairs compels water resource managers to carefully monitor land deformation in the Valley. A persistent drought in the region began in 2012, intensified in 2014, and was abruptly alleviated by a wet period from Dec-2016 to Feb-2018. NASA's UAVSAR L-band synthetic aperture radar acquired 31 high resolution radar images between May-2013 and Nov-2018. The interferometric phase difference between acquisitions is used to develop a time series of vertical displacement and identify and track a rapidly forming subsidence feature adjacent to the California Aqueduct. The surface area of the feature that subsided 10 cm or more by the end of the time series reaches 4452 ha and a 10.5+ km segment of the aqueduct. This study also incorporates extensometer measurements, precise leveling surveys, Sentinel-1A displacement, concurrent water elevation data, well construction reports, nearby extensometer measurements, aquifer material characterization, and environmental conditions. Spatiotemporal data availability limits the appropriateness of calculations and models able to be performed for different sites along the aqueduct. We aim to offer insight into heterogeneous subsurface properties and mechanics, estimate the permanent loss of aquifer storage volume, and identify additional data that would aid water management.}

	journal = {Reports on Progress in Physics},
	abstract = {Geodesy, the oldest science, has become an important discipline in the geosciences, in large part by enhancing Global Positioning System (GPS) capabilities over the last 35 years well beyond the satellite constellation’s original design. The ability of GPS geodesy to estimate 3D positions with millimeter-level precision with respect to a global terrestrial reference frame has contributed to significant advances in geophysics, seismology, atmospheric science, hydrology, and natural hazard science. Monitoring the changes in the positions or trajectories of GPS instruments on the Earth’s land and water surfaces, in the atmosphere, or in space, is important for both theory and applications, from an improved understanding of tectonic and magmatic processes to developing systems for mitigating the impact of natural hazards on society and the environment. Besides accurate positioning, all disturbances in the propagation of the transmitted GPS radio signals from satellite to receiver are mined for information, from troposphere and ionosphere delays for weather, climate, and natural hazard applications, to disturbances in the signals due to multipath reflections from the solid ground, water, and ice for environmental applications. We review the relevant concepts of geodetic theory, data analysis, and physical modeling for a myriad of processes at multiple spatial and temporal scales, and discuss the extensive global infrastructure that has been built to support GPS geodesy consisting of thousands of continuously operating stations. We also discuss the integration of heterogeneous and complementary data sets from geodesy, seismology, and geology, focusing on crustal deformation applications and early warning systems for natural hazards.}

	title = {The application of satellite differential SAR interferometry-derived ground displacements in hydrogeology},
	journal = {Hydrogeology Journal},
	volume = {15},
	number = {1},
	pages = {133-154},
	abstract = {The application of satellite differential synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry, principally coherent (InSAR) and to a lesser extent, persistent-scatterer (PSI) techniques to hydrogeologic studies has improved capabilities to map, monitor, analyze, and simulate groundwater flow, aquifer-system compaction and land subsidence. A number of investigations over the previous decade show how the spatially detailed images of ground displacements measured with InSAR have advanced hydrogeologic understanding, especially when a time series of images is used in conjunction with histories of changes in water levels and management practices. Important advances include: (1) identifying structural or lithostratigraphic boundaries (e.g. faults or transitional facies) of groundwater flow and deformation; (2) defining the material and hydraulic heterogeneity of deforming aquifer-systems; (3) estimating system properties (e.g. storage coefficients and hydraulic conductivities); and (4) constraining numerical models of groundwater flow, aquifer-system compaction, and land subsidence. As a component of an integrated approach to hydrogeologic monitoring and characterization of unconsolidated alluvial groundwater basins differential SAR interferometry contributes unique information that can facilitate improved management of groundwater resources. Future satellite SAR missions specifically designed for differential interferometry will enhance these contributions.},
